# Advent of 2024
I am using this year's AoC to "remember" my rusty Python skills. My ambition - "survival", I would be quite happy already if I make it to the end, hence the code is not polished or even meant to be read by others. But then again, I am also fine to publicly humiliate myself, hence I made this repo _public_.

So far (after day 6) I can say: AoC is also a good way to remember some of the basic concepts (recursion, divide & conquer, ...), and it feels really good to be a bit closer to coding next to the typical decathlon of a digital product manager, i.e., spending most of my time in front of 

⭐
1. Slack,
2. Teams,
3. Figma, 🔴
4. Lucid,
5. Confluence,
6. SAP LeanIX, 🔵
7. Productboard ,
8. at conferences, 🟡
9. in customer meetings, -
10. and of course good ol' Excel!

(Yes, the order is meant to look like a x-mas tree ...) 🎄

Plus: Looking at the results of my coding I am quite happy that I moved over from engineering to product management a long time ago, I guess my team mates would not be excited about my coding style 😳

Last not least, I learned and appreciate quite a bit about the changes in _how_ one can create code these days. And while I am *not* using GenAI to solve any of the puzzles, AI and the wealth of published content is a great resource to quickly translate "algorithmic ideas" into working software. (When I started coding, it was still a thing to buy books, printed on real paper ... 📖)
When it comes to coding environments: I actually started with Replit, and did most of the coding on my phone - I loved it, and they have also great built-in, almost able to ind read when doing auto-completion - until I had used my free coding time already in the middle of day 4 😇 Hence I moved over to GitHub codespaces. I hope that the 30 free hours will suffice to make all the way to Christmas ... 🤞 Long story short, I really enjoy the ease of coding in such pure SaaS setups, not having to worry about runtoime environments etc simplifies things quite a lot.
